Easily add content to the empty cart display in Easy Digital Downloads.

== Description ==

Built for use with the Easy Digital Downloads plugin, this extension provides settings for the display of the [download_checkout] shortcode when no items are in the cart.

Follow EDD Empty Cartâ€™s development on [Github](https://github.com/sdavismedia/edd-empty-cart).

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you have [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) installed.
2. Upload `edd-empty-cart` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Navigate to Downloads -> Settings -> Extensions (tab) in your WordPress dashboard and find the "Empty Cart Settings" section.
5. Adjust your settings and save. You can see the output by viewing your EDD checkout page when there are no items in the cart.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I use this if I use Vendd, which already includes these settings? =

You can. EDD Empty Cart will override Vendd's empty cart settings automatically. EDD Empty Cart offers slightly more control.
